	The space partitioning feature of motelab allows the lab to be split
into multiple zones on which jobs can run simultaneously.  These zones are
defined as a list of mote IDs in a 'zones' table that looks like this:

+-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| name  | varchar(128) |      |     |         |                |
| id    | int(11)      |      | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| motes | text         |      |     |         |                |
+-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

	When a job is scheduled to run on a zone the view-schedule.php page
examines the 'jobfiles' table to discover which programs to run on which
motes.  The information in the jobfiles table is set on the 'motes' tab of the
job creation/edit page.  If jobfiles does not have a program listed for a mote
in the zone then nothing will run on it and the mote will be available to
other jobs.

	It's important to note that all conflict checking is done on a
per-mote basis.  So it's possible to have multiple overlapping zones, and
motelab should just do the right thing if there's a conflict at schedule time.

	After view-schedule.php checks for conflicts it updates the
'jobschedule' table.  The jobschedule table requires a couple new fields for
zone support, and they look like this:

+-------------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field       | Type     | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| zoneid      | int(11)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| moteprogram | text     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-------------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+

	The moteprogram field is set to the moteID/fileID pairs for the zone,
as extracted from the jobfiles table.  The zoneid is set to the id number of
the zone.

	The jobdaemon uses the information in this moteprogram field to
actually program the motes with the different executables.  It also looks at
moteprogram to make sure it only clears programs from the proper motes and not
the whole lab.
